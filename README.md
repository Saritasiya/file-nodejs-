Interface Creation: Creates a readline interface with readline.createInterface.

Task List: Initializes an empty array todos to store tasks.

Menu Function (showMenu): Displays menu options (Add Task, View Tasks, Exit) and waits for user input.

Input Handling Function (handlInput):

Add a Task: Prompts for a task, adds it to the todos array, and displays the menu again.

View Tasks: Displays the current list of tasks in the todos array and shows the menu again.

Exit: Prints a goodbye message and closes the readline interface.

Invalid Option: Informs the user if their choice is invalid and redisplays the menu.
